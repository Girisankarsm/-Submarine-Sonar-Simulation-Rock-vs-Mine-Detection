ðŸŽ¯ Submarine Sonar Simulation: Rock vs Mine Detection
Overview

This project simulates a submarine sonar system to classify underwater objects as Rocks ðŸŸ¢ or Mines ðŸ’£ using machine learning. It uses the UCI Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset to train a RandomForestClassifier and visualizes detections through an interactive terminal animation.

Features

Data Loading & Validation: Automatically detects CSV or whitespace-separated files, ensures numeric features, and validates labels.

Machine Learning Model: Trains a RandomForest classifier, evaluates accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, and saves the model for future use.

Interactive Terminal Simulation:

Submarine ðŸš¢ moves across a grid.

Rocks ðŸŸ¢ and Mines ðŸ’£ move randomly.

Sonar detection radius highlights nearby objects dynamically.

Animated visualization for a cinematic, presentation-ready demo.

Requirements

Python 3.10+

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib, rich

Install dependencies with:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib rich

Usage

Clone or download the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd "machine learning projet"


Activate your Python environment:

source sonar_env/bin/activate


Run the simulation:

python p.py


The program will train the model, evaluate it, and display an interactive ocean simulation with moving submarine, rocks, and mines.

Notes

This is a simulation for educational and demo purposes.

Predictions are based on the Sonar dataset, not real sonar hardware.

Perfect for machine learning portfolios, presentations, or teaching demos.
